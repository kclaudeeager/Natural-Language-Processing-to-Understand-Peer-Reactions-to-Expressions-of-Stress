"@N1181xX What did you see on Trustpilot? I’m just exhausted from it all &amp; communication is shockingly bad! They tried to offer me £500 in compensation, which doesn’t go anywhere near the cost to cover a months rent ffs!!! If I had any choice, I’d go elsewhere!",Negative
"@jenstimp Oh my gosh! So sorry to hear all that, shocking! I really hope you and the kids get something sorted either way. I read some reviews on trustpilot which concerned me now this.",Negative
"@N1181xX This is in Basingstoke! Just had the terrible news that Premier (the warranty company) have walked away, so no warranty sign off! I’m almost out of money for my temporary rental, that I was meant to be in for 2 months, now over 6! My kids &amp; I are almost homeless now!",Negative
"@jenstimp Oh no, we’ve been looking at an Aster home. Which development is this if you don’t mind me asking?",Positive
"@AsterGroupUK I’m in talks with team members &amp; now on level 2 of my complaints! People need to know how long they could be delayed, so they don’t end up severely out of pocket, almost homeless, stressed beyond belief &amp; living in limbo for a year or more!",Positive
@jenstimp Hi Jen - sorry to hear this.  We understand our sales team are in communication about this but please drop us a DM if you’d like a member of the sales team to contact you.,Positive
