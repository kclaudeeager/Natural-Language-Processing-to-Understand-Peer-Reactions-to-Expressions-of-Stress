We are in a similar situation where the house is there, we have been inside it &amp; looked round, yet it still won’t get signed off \\uD83D\\uDE33 It’s so disheartening \\uD83E\\uDD7A\"},{\"id\":\"1536740826193207296\",\"text\":\"@jenstimp That’s nearly a year!! So sorry to hear this, it must have ruined any excitement completely for you all. Site we were looking at is in Farnham. From what I can see all the houses are ready but the road doesn’t seem to be finished\"},{\"id\":\"1536709197248745472\",\"text\":\"@N1181xX Where abouts are you looking? They’ve said that the delays are lack of builders &amp; materials, which is ridiculous as they have continued to build other houses on the site! I was meant to move August 2021 &amp; am still waiting, with no move date in sight!\"},{\"id\":\"1536684479720443907\",\"text\":\"@jenstimp Someone else in the same boat as you on trustpilot plus others. Have they told you what the delay is? Phase 1 of where I’m looking was sold out January or before I think, but nobody has moved in yet and the phase 2 launch has been pushed back. Houses are all complete too.\"},{\"id\":\"1536616143942733825\",\"text\":\"@N1181xX What did you see on Trustpilot? I’m just exhausted from it all &amp; communication is shockingly bad! They tried to offer me £500 in compensation, which doesn’t go anywhere near the cost to cover a months rent ffs!!! If I had any choice, I’d go elsewhere!\"},{\"id\":\"1536599528752701440\",\"text\":\"@jenstimp Oh my gosh! So sorry to hear all that, shocking! I really hope you and the kids get something sorted either way. I read some reviews on trustpilot which concerned me now this.\"},{\"id\":\"1536520173955473411\",\"text\":\"@N1181xX This is in Basingstoke! Just had the terrible news that Premier (the warranty company) have walked away, so no warranty sign off! I’m almost out of money for my temporary rental, that I was meant to be in for 2 months, now over 6! My kids &amp; I are almost homeless now!\"},{\"id\":\"1536433360624558081\",\"text\":\"@jenstimp Oh no, we’ve been looking at an Aster home. Which development is this if you don’t mind me asking?\"},{\"id\":\"1534577044276879362\",\"text\":\"@AsterGroupUK I’m in talks with team members &amp; now on level 2 of my complaints! People need to know how long they could be delayed, so they don’t end up severely out of pocket, almost homeless, stressed beyond belief &amp; living in limbo for a year or more!\"},{\"id\":\"1534567076408459265\",\"text\":\"@jenstimp Hi Jen - sorry to hear this.
